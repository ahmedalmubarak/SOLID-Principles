# SOLID Principles

This repository contains examples and explanations of the SOLID principles in object-oriented design.

## What are SOLID Principles?

SOLID is an acronym that stands for five principles of object-oriented programming, aimed at making software designs more understandable, flexible, and maintainable. These principles were introduced by Robert C. Martin (Uncle Bob) and have become fundamental concepts in software development:

1. **Single Responsibility Principle (SRP)**: A class should have only one reason to change, meaning it should have only one responsibility.

2. **Open-Closed Principle (OCP)**: Software entities should be open for extension but closed for modification, allowing new functionality to be added without altering existing code.

3. **Liskov Substitution Principle (LSP)**: Objects of a superclass should be replaceable with objects of its subclasses without affecting the correctness of the program.

4. **Interface Segregation Principle (ISP)**: Clients should not be forced to depend on interfaces they don't use. Instead, interfaces should be specific to the client's needs.

5. **Dependency Inversion Principle (DIP)**: High-level modules should not depend on low-level modules. Both should depend on abstractions, and abstractions should not depend on details. 

## Contents

This repository includes examples and code snippets illustrating each of the SOLID principles. Each principle is explained in detail along with practical examples to demonstrate its application.
